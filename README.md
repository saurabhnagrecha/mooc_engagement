# MOOC Research on edX data

## Our paper
Please watch this space for an updated code-base for our paper "MOOC Dropout Prediction: Lessons Learned from Making Pipelines Interpretable". We are excited to annouce that this work will be featured at WWW Conference 2017.  The camera ready version of the paper is available [here](http://www3.nd.edu/~snagrech/papers/MOOCWWW2017.pdf).

## About this repository
The current notebook describes some of the rudimentary preprocessing steps we took to convert raw edX server logs to structured Pandas dataframes (dumped to file). We will have the codebase available soon.

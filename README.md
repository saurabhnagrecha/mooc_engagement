# MOOC Research on edX data

This is the underground version of the MOOC Engagement research at Notre Dame. If you are seeing this, you are either part of the chosen few (and/or a 1337 |-|@XXoR!).

The code for this research is broken down into the following components (the file structure reflects this hierarchy as well):
* Feature Engineering:
    * Extract user agent data (A)
    * Extract engagement data (B)
* Engagement Prediction
    * Divide students into train and test sets
    * Create featuresets for A, B, and A+B
    * Predict engagement longitudinally
